# Exercise Description
> For your exercise 1 you need to create an app named your profile app. At the start of the app, you need to select your hobbies. You are required to list at least 10 of your hobbies. Then when I click the navigation button (upper right button/icon). It will be redirected to a page. The page contacts My Profile as the header. Then it shows your name, student number, and a minimum 5 sentence description of yourself. Then all the hobbies you selected on the 1st page. The theme of your app should show your favorite colors. 

# Naming your App

- What did you add to the code.

In order to satisfy the specifications stated in this exercise, I added a couple of things to my code from the tutorial of developing my first flutter app. 
I started by deleting the code that generated the pair words, and then I formed a list out of the string of hobbies. 
Instead of the pair words, I added hobbies to the app. 
For the second screen (My Profile), I inserted the text for the information needed before the selected hobbies using the insert feature of lists. 
I also used the separatorBuilder for the lines in between the hobbies.

- How are you able to do the exercise.

I was able to do the exercise mostly by basing off my code from codelabs (Write your first Flutter app). I also explored the internet and read a lot about the different components of this language in order to use them in the implementation of this app.

- Challenges met while doing the exercise.

The main challenge that I faced which doing this exercise is making myself familiar with the programming language. I had to re-read the material several times in order to fully understand the purpose of each component added to the code. I also cannot make the mobile emulator work while making the exercise thus used Google Chrome in order to see the application itself.

- Happy paths and Unhappy paths encountered.

An unhappy path I encountered is when I only chose one hobby and then proceeded to the second page (My Profile). It produced an error about inserting a text widget instead of a list tile for the information needed. I solved this by simply enclosing the text into a list tile. After fixing this slight error, all the paths I have encountered are happy paths. No matter how many hobbies one picks, the program now runs.

:smile_cat: contact your lab instructor if you have any concerns, inquiries or problems in your exercise.
